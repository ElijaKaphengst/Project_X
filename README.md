# Project_X - 5th Semester Project
 
This is my 5th semester (Autumn 2018 - Winter 2019) project of my Game-Designer education.

It includes the Unity project (`Project_X` folder) and a demo build (`Demo Build` folder).

The project is an first person loot shooter. 
It has an inventory, a simple skill tree, enemies, and weapons with recoil, bullet drop and a weapon wheel.
