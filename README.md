# Git_Project_X
 
This is my 5th semester project of my Game-Designer education.
It includes the Unity project ("Project_X" folder) and a demo build ("Demo Build" folder).

The project is an first person loot shooter. It has an inventory, a simple skill tree, enemy, and weapons with recoil, bullet drop and a weapon wheel.
